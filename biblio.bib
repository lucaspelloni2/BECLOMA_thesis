abstract = {Recently, the rise in popularity of mobile applications for mobile devices and the growth estimates for this market make mobile application development a strategic business sector. As a variety of new scenarios for mobile devices and applications emerges, users and developers will require improved reliability, usability, performance, and security. In such a context, open platforms for mobile application development, such as the Android operating system, are assuming a preponderant role.To satisfy this growing request for high quality applications, developers must devote greater effort and attention to software development processes. In particular, testing and its automation play a strategic part for assuring the quality of applications.This chapter analyzes the main challenges and open issues in the field of mobile application testing for the Android platform, with an emphasis on advances in the field. We present suitable and effective principles, guidelines, models, techniques, and technologies for Android application testing and conclude with an outline of future perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Nagappan2015,
abstract = {â€”There has been tremendous growth in the use of mobile devices over the last few years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications for these mobile devices often called as 'apps'. Current estimates indicate that there are hundreds of thousands of mobile app developers. As a result, in recent years, there has been an increasing amount of software engineering research conducted on mobile apps to help such mobile app developers. In this paper, we discuss current and future research trends within the framework of the various stages in the software development life-cycle: requirements (including non-functional), design and development, testing, and maintenance. While there are several non-functional requirements, we focus on the topics of energy and security in our paper, since mobile apps are not necessarily built by large companies that can afford to get experts for solving these two topics. For the same reason we also discuss the monetizing aspects of a mobile app at the end of the paper. For each topic of interest, we first present the recent advances done in these stages and then we present the challenges present in current work, followed by the future opportunities and the risks present in pursuing such research.},
