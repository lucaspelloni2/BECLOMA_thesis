The experience I lived with the implementation and subsequently the writing of my bachelor thesis was undoubtedly one of the most rewarding academic experiences of my life until now. During these six months, I learned to know more in-depth the programming world, appreciating more and more its challenges and its beauties.
However, the realization of my thesis would not have been possible without the help of few people. First, I would like to thank all those people who have contributed directly to the realization of my bachelor thesis. After that, those who indirectly allowed me to reach such an important goal of my life: my bachelor's degree.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Giovanni Grano. I would like to thank him for the patience he has shown during the past six months, for its guidance and support, for its constructive criticism and for having always encouraged me to achieve my best. I think one of the best things of my thesis was that he always allowed me to experiment and to be creative with the assigned tasks. I could  "bang my head" against the new challenges and this helped me to find the right solutions.
The final result of my thesis would not have been possible without his help. 
I would like to offer special thanks to Dr. Sebastiano Panichella for believing in me from the beginning and for giving me such a high-level thesis. Thanks for allowing me to discover a branch of computer science that I did not know so in detail before. 
I thank also my two computer science schoolmates, Ile and Erion, who helped me a lot with their knowledge about android mobile devices.
Finally, I would like to thank Professor Gall for giving me the opportunity to work together with the Software Evolution \& Architecture Lab at the University of Zurich, allowing me to use the most state-of-the-art infrastructures and technologies for my thesis. 

I would like to spend also some words for those people, who support me during the whole bachelor degree. 
%and I could explore it in a more practical way.
