The experience I lived with the implementation and subsequently the writing of my bachelor thesis was undoubtedly one of the most rewarding academic experiences of my life until now. During these six months, I learned to know more in-depth the programming world, appreciating more and more its challenges and its beauties.
However, the realization of my thesis would not have been possible without the help of few people. First, I would like to thank all those people who have contributed directly to the realization of my bachelor thesis. After that, those who indirectly allowed me to reach such an important goal of my life: my bachelor's degree.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Giovanni Grano. I would like to thank him for the patience he has shown during the past six months, for its guidance and support, for its constructive criticism and for having always encouraged me to achieve my best. I think one of the best things of my thesis was that he always allowed me to experiment and to be creative with the assigned tasks. I could  "bang my head" against the new challenges and this helped me to find the right solutions.
The final result of my thesis would not have been possible without his help. 
I would like to offer special thanks to Dr. Sebastiano Panichella for believing in me from the beginning and for giving me such a high-level thesis. Thanks for allowing me to discover a branch of computer science that I did not know so in detail before. 
I thank also my two computer science schoolmates, Ile and Erion, who helped me a lot with their knowledge about android mobile devices.
Finally, I would like to thank Professor Gall for giving me the opportunity to work together with the Software Evolution \& Architecture Lab at the University of Zurich, allowing me to use the most state-of-the-art infrastructures and technologies for my thesis. 

I would like to spend some words for those people, who have supported me during the whole bachelor degree. 
I would like to thank my parents for being there for me throughout all my bachelor track and for supporting me in times of need. 
I never could have done it without you and I hope you would be proud of me. 
%and I could explore it in a more practical way.

\begin{abstract}
In last years, the massive distribution of mobile devices like smartphones, tables and more recently wearables, radically changed our social life. Since the introduction of the first modern smartphone, the iPhone in the 2007, we witnesses a gradual shift from the traditional paradigm about use of technology, entering in the called \textit{post-pc} era. 
Nowadays, the mobile market attracts always more developers and software houses. To sustain this fierce competition, they need to build high quality apps and at the same time, reach the market as soon as possible. It comes naturally to note that testing plays an important role in this process. 
Research focused for decades on traditional testing, aiming at reaching its maximum automation. However, automated testing for mobile applications presents different challenges and limitations that still need to be properly investigated.
This thesis work tries to shed some initial light into possible solutions for such problems. In particular, we focused our attention to the knowledge that can be extracted by mobile stores. Indeed, such stores represent an enormous amount of data easily available, like user reviews, and are an unmatched opportunities for software engineering research.
Our final aim is to preliminarily demonstrate how such user feedback can be in some way exploited to integrate and complement the state of art Android automated testing tools. Our results show that a noticeable set of problem can be actually detected only though user feedback. Such observation puts the first stone down for a new paradigm of \textit{user oriented testing}.
