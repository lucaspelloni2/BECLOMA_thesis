In the following two sections, I summarize the main related works on \textit{automated testing tools for Android apps} and on \textit{the broadly usage of user reviews from app store in Software maintenance activities}. 
An overview of the recent research in the field can be found in the survey by Martin \etal \cite{Martin:tse2017}. 
\section{Automated tools for Android Testing}

Unlike traditional software, mobile applications are mainly exercised by user inputs. \\ 
In the mobile world, an exremely valid approach to ensure the realiability of these applications is the GUI\footnote{Graphical User Interface} Testing. \\ 
In particular, in this kind of testing, each test case is designed and run in the form of sequences of GUI interaction events.  \\
Depending on their exploration strategy, there are in general three approaches for creating a generation of user inputs on a mobile device \cite{dynodroid, areWeThereYet}: \textit{random testing} \cite{dynodroid, monkey}, \textit{systematic testing} \cite{evodroid} and \textit{model-based testing} \cite{mobiguitar, guidedgui, mining}. 
\subsubsection{Fuzz testing}
When test automation does occur, it typically relies on Google's Android \textit{Monkey} command-line \cite{monkey}. Since it comes directly integrated in Android Studio, the standard IDE for Android Development, it is regarded as the current state-of-practice \cite{Mahmood2014}.\\
This tool simply generates, for the specified Android applications, pseudo-random streams of user events into the system, with the goal to stress the \textit{AUT\footnote{Application Under Test}}\cite{monkey}. \\ 
The effort required for using \textit{Monkey} is very low \cite{areWeThereYet}. Users have to specify in the command-line the type and the number of the UI events they want to generate and in addition they can establish the verbosity level of the \textit{Monkey log}. \\
The set of possible \textit{Monkey parameters} can be found in the official \textit{User Guide} for Monkey \cite{monkey}. \\
The kind of testing implemented by Monkey follows a black-box approach. 
Despite the robustness, the user friendliness \cite{areWeThereYet, dynodroid} and the capacity to find out new bugs outside the stated scenarios  \cite{monkey_2}, this tool may be inefficient if the \textit{AUT} would require some human intelligence (\textit{e.g.} a login field) for providing sensible inputs \cite{dynodroid}. \\
For this reason, \textit{Monkey} may cause highly redundant and senseless user events. Even though it would find out a new bug for a given app, the steps for reproducing it may be very difficult to follow, due also to the randomness in the testing strategy implemented by \textit{Monkey}\cite{monkey_2}. \\
\textbf{Dynodroid} \cite{dynodroid} is also a random-based testing approach. However, this tool has been discovered being more efficient than \textit{Monkey} in the exploration process  \cite{areWeThereYet}. \\
One of the reasons behind a better efficacy has been that \textit{Dynodroid} is able to generate both \textit{UI inputs} and \textit{system events} (unlike \textit{Monkey}, which can only generate UI events) \cite{areWeThereYet}. \\  
Indeed, \textit{Dynodroid} can simulate an incoming SMS message on a mobile device, a notification of another app or an request of use for available wifi networks in the neighborhood \cite{dynodroid}. All these events represent \textit{non-UI events} and they are often unpredictable and therefore difficult to simulate in a suitable context (cita?). \\
\textit{Dynodroid }views the \textit{AUT} as an event-driven program and follows a cyclical mechanism, also known as the \textit{observe-select-execute} cycle \cite{dynodroid}. First of all, it \textit{observes} which events are relevant to the \textit{AUT} in the current state, grouping they together (an event must be considered relevant if it triggers a part of code which is part of the \textit{AUT}). After that, it \textit{selects} one of the previously observed events with a randomized algorithm \cite{dynodroid, areWeThereYet} and finally \textit{executes} it. After the execution of that event it reaches a new state and can start the cycle again. \\
Another advantage of \textit{Dynodroid} compared to \textit{Monkey} is that it allows users to interact in the testing process providing UI inputs. In doing so, \textit{Dynodroid} is able to exploit the benefits of combining automated with manual testing \cite{dynodroid}.

\subsubsection{Systematic testing}
The tools using a systematic explorations strategy rely on more sophisticated techniques, such as symbolic execution and evolutionary algorithms \cite{areWeThereYet}. \\
\textbf{Sapienz} \cite{sapienz} introduced a Pareto multi-objective search-based technique to simultaneously maximize coverage and fault revelation, while minimizing the sequence lengths. \\ It combines the above mentioned random-based approach with a new systematic exploration and as mentioned in the experimental results published on \cite{sapienz}, \textit{Sapienz} is an outperformer in the automated mobile testing area. \\
Indeed, in an empirical study described on \cite{sapienz}, \textit{Sapienz} has illustrated the strength of its approach. It found from a set of 68 benchmark apps, 104 unique crashes (while \textit{Monkey} 41 and \textit{Dynodroid} 13).

\subsubsection{Model-based testing}
Model-based tools for testing Android applications are quite popular \cite{sapienz}. Most of these tools \cite{mobiguitar,guiripper, swifthand, guidedgui, mining} generate UI events from models, which are either manually designed or created from XML configuration files \cite{sapienz}. \\
For example, \textit{SwiftHand}\footnote{https://github.com/wtchoi/SwiftHand} uses a machine learning algorithm to learn a model of the current \textit{AUT}. This final state machine model \cite{areWeThereYet} generates UI events and due their execution the app reaches new unexplored states. After that, it exploits the execution of these events to adapt and refine the model \cite{swifthand}. \textit{SwiftHand}, in a similar way to \textit{Monkey} generates only touching and scrolling UI events and is not able to generate System events \cite{areWeThereYet}.

\section{Usage of users reviews in Software maintenance activities}
The concept of app store mining was first introduced by \textit{Harman} \etal
\cite{appstoremining}. In this context, many researchers focused on the analysis of user reviews to support the maintenance and evolution of mobile applications \cite{surveyappstore}.
