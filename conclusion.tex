\label{chapter:conclusion}
In my thesis we investigated the importance of integrating user reviews in the validation process of mobile applications. 
For this purpose, we introduced an approach called \toolname\ which is able to (i) test a set of apps and extract possible crashes, (ii) form a bucket of unique crash reports and 
(iii) investigate the complementarity between crash-related user reviews and the bucketed stack traces. 
With the aim to evaluate the performance of \toolname, we performed an empirical study 
over a dataset containing different types of mobile applications. 
First, we downloaded our sample of APKs from the \textit{FDroid API} and we launched an experiment on them. 
Afterwards, we reported its results, \ie the total number of crashes and unique crashes which occurred during the testing phase. 
Then, we created a bucket of unique crash logs. For this purpose, we first manually built an oracle according to the crash reports we collected. 
Afterwards, we adapted its threshold in order to reproduce that bucket. 
Finally, we started our linking procedure by linking the crash-related user reviews and the stack traces we bucketed. 
Again, we reported its results in Chapter \ref{chapter:results}. 
 
 
We strongly believe, that our findings might convince other mobile developers to perform such an \textit{user-oriented testing} by validating the reliability of their mobile applications. 
Indeed, despite \toolname\ still remains in an experimental stage, we argue that our results are quite promising. 
However, we are conscious that we tested our approach with a small dataset and thus we may adapt both the clustering and the linking threshold whether \toolname\ would be used with another, maybe greater set of apps. 
With a new set of apps, we believe that \toolname\ would require some manual effort for setting the correct threshold. 

We are convinced that our findings and preliminary results lay the foundations for further research  into the field of \textit{integration of user feedback into the testing process}. 
At this stage, \toolname\ operates with a relative small number of user reviews and mobile applications. It would be nice to test the effectiveness of its approach with a very large amount of both sources of information. \\

There are different directions to investigate for future work. 
First, it could be possible to introduce a new tool which would be able to (i) \textit{summarize} stack
traces and user reviews linked together, supporting the activities performed by developers in their bug fixing sessions. 
(ii) create a \textit{prioritisation scheme} for the generated failures taking into account the user reviews and finally (iii) \textit{generate} specific \textit{test cases} directly from user reviews. \\
Furthermore, we plan to improve the \textit{augmenting process} of the stack traces implemented by \toolname. 
Indeed, we are convinced that a better selection of the words which augment the stack traces would improve the linking scores between crash-related user and these stack traces. 
For instance, we could consider not only the source code methods included in the stack traces but also the common classes among them. 
This would imply a greater set of words for the stack traces which may results in a better linking score. 


Finally, we could implement a further feature for \toolname\, which is in charge of additionally  filtering the reviews. 
Indeed, our approach considers also these reviews which present a positive connotation, \ie those that not refer to any crash but just express a positive opinion about the given app. 
For instance, we could try to conceive a filter function which analyses the reviews and discards, according to an external text file containing some stop words, those which express a position opinion about the app.
